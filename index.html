    <H2>My Motivation</H2>

    <p><strong>Why did I create this page?</strong></p>
    <p>I wanted a space where I could save my thoughts, goals, and suggestions. Using notepad or other web services didn't feel comfortable. </p>
    <hr class="line">
    <p><strong>Why is it so important?</strong> </p>
    <p>Well,I haven't been reading for a long time, and I want to improve my English skills. Creating this page helps me organize and structure my thoughts more effectively.</p>
